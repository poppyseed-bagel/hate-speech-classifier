*Content warning: This competition makes use of data from a project to automate moderation of toxic speech online. Many comments in this dataset contain hate speech and upsetting content.*

This problem set involves classification of toxic comments in Wikipedia talk pages.

Your task is to use what you have learned in class to build a classifier that performs well on a test set with the true labels obfuscated to prevent cheating. All of the comments were hand-labeled by multiple coders for the paper ["Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08914).
